# # Pseudocode:

import path

Import the file in csv format

Check the current file path and set a new file path to the file

Initialize a list ot hold the Profit/Losses and Dates

Declare a variable for number of months and set to 0

Initialize the line number variable

Open the file as a readable object and pass in the csv file in a csv reader

Reader the header in the data file

Use a for loop to read each row of data and: 

    count the loops
    append the data from months to the date list
    append profits and losses to the profit and loss list

Set metric values:
     max pnl increase, 
     max pnl decrease, 
     total change in pnl
     average change in pnl
     total profit/loss 

Declare a variable for total profit loss set it to equal the first value in the profit loss list

Use a fore loop to calculate max, min, total, and average of profit and losses using the months as index begining in row 1
    
    aggregate the total profit loss from the second value to the end (first value is already in total)
    
    find change in profit loss with total profit loss for each date minus profit loss for each date minus 1
    
    aggregate the change in profit/loss for each period

    Calculate the average change in profit/loss by dividing the total change profit by the total months minus 1 to account for the index
    
    use if else logic to find the maximum increase, maximum decrease in change in revenue with corresponding date index
    
set the output path file

write the results into txt file with file write
